This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug where an overly broad selector causes unintended styling on elements. The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from a selector that's too general, impacting elements beyond the intended target. The solution refines the selector to target only the desired elements, thereby resolving the unintended styling.
